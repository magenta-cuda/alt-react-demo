# alt-react-demo

**This is a port of sv-rr to the Bootstrap toolkit.**

This a re-implementation of sv-rr (which is a React/Redux application) using only native Javascript. I have thought for some time that the ideas of React and Redux are quite simple and that for smaller less complex applications these ideas could be implemented directly in Javascript without using a heavy framework. This is my first attempt at implementing the ideas of React and Redux directly in Javascript.
